\section{Introduction}
Collision detection is a fundamental concept in game development, determining
when two or more objects intersect within a game world. It is crucial for many
game mechanics, including physics, AI behavior, and rendering effects.
Essentially, collision detection answers the question:

\begin{displayquote}
    \textit{Given two entities, each with a position and shape, do they intersect? If so,
        how can we resolve the collision?}
\end{displayquote}

In this document, I will discuss various methods for collision detection and
collision resolution using bounding shapes. These methods and techniques are
essential for the creation of efficient and engaging games. This document is
based on course material from COMP 4300 at the Memorial University of
Newfoundland as well as my own personal study.
