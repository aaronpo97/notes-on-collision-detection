\chapter{Code Snippets}

The following code snippets are implementations of the \texttt{Vec2},
\texttt{Entity}, and \texttt{EntityManager} classes in C++.

\section{Vec2}
The \texttt{Vec2} class is a simple two-dimensional vector class that provides
basic vector operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
division. It is used in this document for various collision detection and
resolution algorithms.

\section{Entity}
The \texttt{Entity} class represents an object within the game world and
consists of various components, such as its transform (position, rotation,
scale, velocity), bounding shape (circle, rectangle), and other properties like
its name and tag.

\section{EntityManager}
The \texttt{EntityManager} class is responsible for managing a collection of
entities in the game world. It provides methods for adding, removing, and
updating entities, as well as methods for querying entities based on a tag.
