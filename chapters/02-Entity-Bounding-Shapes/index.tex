\chapter{Detecting Collisions involving Entity Bounding Shapes}
Everyday objects have arbitrary shapes and interaction surfaces. For example,
consider a teacup. A teacup has a complex shape consisting of many curves and
edges. Accurately simulating the collision of a teacup requires considering
both the teacup's shape and the shape of the object it collides with. With many
complex shapes, collision detection becomes computationally expensive.

To address this issue, we can use bounding shapes that approximate an object's
shape to calculate collisions more efficiently. We do this by enclosing an
object in a primitive type:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{2D:} Circle, Rectangle, Triangle, Octagon
    \item \textbf{3D:} Sphere, Box, Cylinder, Cone
\end{itemize}

By using these primitive shapes, collision detection becomes simpler and less
computationally demanding.
