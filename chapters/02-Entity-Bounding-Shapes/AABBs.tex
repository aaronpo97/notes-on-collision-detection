\section{Axis Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABB)}
In 2D games, objects are often enclosed within rectangles designed to encompass
their width and height, facilitating straightforward collision detection.
Axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABBs) are a specific type of bounding rectangle
used to simplify collision detection between rectangles. Unlike rectangles that
can be oriented in various directions, AABBs are aligned parallel to the $x$
and $y$ axes. This alignment streamlines collision detection algorithms,
allowing us to use simple geometric calculations to determine if two AABBs
intersect.

While AABBs typically encompass the entire width and height of an object, there
are exceptions where the object's image may exceed or be smaller than the
bounding box. This situation is common in animation, where a consistent image
size is used across frames, potentially resulting in sprites that extend beyond
the box's boundaries. Despite these imperfections, which are generally
acceptable in animation, the bounding box is sized to encompass the entire
image.

For example, Mario's standing pose neatly fits within his bounding box, whereas
Megaman's shooting pose extends beyond its boundaries. These variations
highlight how bounding boxes accommodate diverse shapes and sizes in 2D game
design.

\subsection{Point and AABB Intersection}

The simplest calculation for AABBs is to check whether a point is inside the
rectangle. Given a point $p$ and a rectangle with corners $c_1$ and $c_2$, we
can determine if the point is inside the rectangle by checking if the point's x
and y coordinates are within the rectangle's x and y coordinates. This is done
by the following formula:
\begin{center}
    \textit{Point $p$ is inside rectangle with corners $c_1$ and $c_2$ if and only if:} \\
    $(p.x > c_1.x) \land (p.x < c_2.x) \land (p.y > c_1.y) \land (p.y < c_2.y)$
\end{center}

If the rectangle is defined by a top left corner $c$, width $w$, and height
$h$, the equation can be modified to:

\begin{center}
    \textit{Point $p$ is inside rectangle with top left corner $c$, width $w$ and height $h$ if and only if:} \\
    $(p.x > c.x) \land (p.x < c.x + w) \land (p.y > c.y) \land (p.y < c.y + h)$
\end{center}
When broken down, the formula is evaluating four conditions:
\begin{multicols}{2}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The point's x-coordinate is to the right of the left side of the rectangle.
              \begin{equation*}
                  \begin{aligned}
                      p.x & > c_1.x \\
                      p.x & > c.x
                  \end{aligned}
              \end{equation*}

        \item The point's x-coordinate is to the left of the right side of the rectangle.
              \begin{equation*}
                  \begin{aligned}
                      p.x & < c_2.x   \\
                      p.x & < c.x + w
                  \end{aligned}
              \end{equation*}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{multicols}

\begin{multicols}{2}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[3.]The point's y-coordinate is above the bottom side of the rectangle.
        \begin{equation*}
            \begin{aligned}
                p.y & > c_1.y \\
                p.y & > c.y
            \end{aligned}
        \end{equation*}

        \item[4.] The point's y-coordinate is below the top side of the rectangle.
            \begin{equation*}
                \begin{aligned}
                    p.y & < c_2.y   \\
                    p.y & < c.y + h
                \end{aligned}
            \end{equation*}
    \end{enumerate}

\end{figure}

Given a rectangle with a top left corner $c = (3, 3)$, width $w = 5$, and
height $h = 7$, and a point $p = (5, 5)$, use math to determine if the point
lies within the rectangle.

\subsubsection{Mathematical Solution}
First, calculate the point's x and y coordinates relative to the rectangle's
top left corner:

\begin{equation*}
    \begin{aligned}
        p.x & = 5 - 3 = 2 \\
        p.y & = 5 - 3 = 2
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}

Next, check if the point lies within the rectangle:

\begin{equation*}
    \begin{aligned}
        (2 > 0) \land (2 < 5) \land (2 > 0) \land (2 < 7) \rightarrow \text{Point lies within rectangle}. \\
        \textnormal{\textbf{TRUE}} \land \textnormal{\textbf{TRUE}} \land \textnormal{\textbf{TRUE}} \land \textnormal{\textbf{TRUE}} \rightarrow \text{Point lies within rectangle}.
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}

Since all four conditions are met, the point lies within the rectangle.

\subsection{AABB Intersection}

Determining if two AABBs intersect is a relatively simple task. Given two
AABBs, one may be inclined to check for collision using the point inside AABB
method. However, this is not the most efficient method, as it requires checking
all four corners of one rectangle against the other rectangle. Instead, we can
use an algorithm that detects both horizontal and vertical overlap.

Given two AABBs with top left corners $c_1$ and $c_2$, we can determine if they
overlap horizontally by checking if the right side of the first rectangle is to
the right of the left side of the second rectangle and vice versa. This is done
by the following formula:

\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
         & \textit{Rectangles overlap horizontally if and only if:} \\
         & (c_1.x < c_2.x + c_2.w) \land (c_1.x + c_1.w > c_2.x)
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

In a similar manner, we can determine if the rectangles overlap vertically by
checking if the top side of the first rectangle is above the bottom side of the
second rectangle and vice versa. This is done by the following formula:

\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
         & \textit{Rectangles overlap vertically if and only if:} \\
         & (c_1.y < c_2.y + c_2.h) \land (c_1.y + c_1.h > c_2.y)
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Put all together, the AABBs overlap if and only if they overlap both
horizontally and vertically. This is done by the following formula:

\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
         & \hspace{1.1em} (c_1.x < c_2.x + c_2.w) \\
         & \land (c_1.x + c_1.w > c_2.x)          \\
         & \land (c_1.y < c_2.y + c_2.h)          \\
         & \land (c_1.y + c_1.h > c_2.y)
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \begin{scope}[yscale=-1, yshift=-5cm, xshift=5cm, scale=0.4]

            \drawaxesgrid{15}{20}

            % a point at the origin (0, 0) 
            \filldraw [black] (0, 0) circle (5pt) {};

            % First rectangle
            \draw [black, thick] (3, 3) rectangle (8, 10);
            \draw[black, thick, -] (3, 3) -- (8, 3) node[midway, below] {$w_1$};
            \draw[black, thick, -] (3, 3) -- (3, 10) node[midway, left] {$h_1$};
            % a point at the top left corner of the first rectangle

            \filldraw [black] (3, 3) circle (4pt) node[anchor=north east] {$c_1$};
            % Second rectangle
            \draw [black, thick] (7, 6) rectangle (12, 16);
            \draw[black, thick, -] (7, 6) -- (12, 6) node[midway, below] {$w_2$};
            \draw[black, thick, -] (7, 6) -- (7, 16) node[midway, left]
            {$h_2$};
            % a point at the top left corner of the second rectangle
            \filldraw [black] (7, 6) circle (4pt) node[anchor=north east] {$c_2$};

        \end{scope}
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

Given two rectangles with top left corners $c_1 = (3, 3)$ and $c_2 = (7, 6)$,
widths $w_1 = 5$ and $w_2 = 5$, and heights $h_1 = 7$ and $h_2 = 10$, use math
to determine if the rectangles intersect.

\subsubsection{Mathematical Solution}
First, check if the rectangles overlap horizontally:

\begin{equation*}
    \begin{aligned}
        (3 < 7 + 5) \land (3 + 5 > 7) & \rightarrow \text{Rectangles overlap horizontally}. \\
        \textnormal{\textbf{TRUE}}    & \rightarrow \text{Rectangles overlap horizontally}.
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}

Next, check if the rectangles overlap vertically:

\begin{equation*}
    \begin{aligned}
        (3 < 6 + 10) \land (3 + 7 > 6) & \rightarrow \text{Rectangles overlap vertically}. \\
        \textnormal{\textbf{TRUE}}     & \rightarrow \text{Rectangles overlap vertically}.
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}

Since the rectangles overlap both horizontally and vertically, they intersect.

\subsubsection{Code Solution}

Here is an implementation of the AABB intersection algorithm in C++:

\begin{mdframed}[linecolor=black!30!white,linewidth=.5pt,extratopheight=1em]
    \lstinputlisting[language=C++]{code-examples/src/collision-detection/AABBIntersection.cpp}
\end{mdframed}

It is important to note that the above formula can only check whether or nor
not two AABBs intersect. It does not provide information on how much they
intersect.

To determine the overlap, we can use a calculation that takes a center point
and the width and height of the bounding box. This is done as follows:

Given two AABBs with centers $c_1$ and $c_2$, widths $w_1$ and $w_2$, and
heights $h_1$ and $h_2$,

\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        \Delta                        & = \left\{ \left| c_1.x - c_2.x \right| , \left| c_1.y - c_2.y \right| \right\}                                                                                     \\
        O                             & = \left\{ \left[ \left( \frac{w_1}{2} + \frac{w_2}{2} \right) - \Delta_x \right] , \left[ \left( \frac{h_1}{2} + \frac{h_2}{2} \right) - \Delta_y \right] \right\} \\
        ( O_x > 0 ) \land ( O_y > 0 ) & \rightarrow \text{AABBs intersect}
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

In this formula, the vector $\Delta$ represents the absolute difference between
the center coordinates of the two AABBs along the $x$ and $y$ axes.

The vector $O$ represents the overlap between the two AABBs along the $x$ and
$y$ axes. The overlap along each axis is calculated by subtracting the
difference between the centers from the sum of the half-widths (for the $x$
axis) or half heights (for the $y$ axis) of the two AABBs.

\subsubsection{Example}

Given two AABBs with centers $c_1 = (3, 3)$ and $c_2 = (7, 6)$, widths $w_1 =
    5$ and $w_2 = 5$, and heights $h_1 = 7$ and $h_2 = 10$, use math to determine
the overlap between the two AABBs.

\subsubsection{Mathematical Solution}

First, calculate the absolute difference between the centers of the two AABBs:

\begin{equation*}
    \begin{aligned}
        \Delta_x & = \left| 3 - 7 \right| = 4 \\
        \Delta_y & = \left| 3 - 6 \right| = 3
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}

Next, calculate the overlap between the two AABBs along the $x$ and $y$ axes:

\begin{equation*}
    \begin{aligned}
        O_x & = \left( \frac{5}{2} + \frac{5}{2} \right) - 4 = 1    \\
        O_y & = \left( \frac{7}{2} + \frac{10}{2} \right) - 3 = 3.5
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}

Finally, check if the AABBs intersect:

\begin{equation*}
    \begin{aligned}
        (1 > 0) \land (3.5 > 0)    & \rightarrow \text{AABBs intersect} \\
        \textnormal{\textbf{TRUE}} & \rightarrow \text{AABBs intersect}
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}

Since the overlap along both axes is positive, the AABBs intersect.
